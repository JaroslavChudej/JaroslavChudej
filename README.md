- âš¡ Fun facts: 
  - As a teenager in early 90s, I started programming in assembly language for Z80, and Amiga few years later (if you can remember what these were) but abandoned programming at my 18 to look for a proper career! :thinking: 
  - I spent last decade in managment and consulting only to realise that most clients need expertise in IT/CS area.
  - Currently in transition from current consulting and coaching career into programming, which I could have started 25 years ago without much of a struggle if I didn't have a second thought.
